## Unit 1 
#### Task 9

No 1:
In the United States, Stocks have been falling since April on concerns about the recovery.
This week, a business research group reported a drop in consumer confidence after three months of gains.
New jobless claims rose in the latest government report.
Still, employment expert John Challenger says his findings suggest that the nation's employers are not expecting a double dip recession.
He points to a big drop in the number of plan job cuts announced by employers over the past six months.

No 2.
30 years ago, women earned $0.62 for every dollar that men earned.
Now, for those who usually work full time, women earn about 80% of what men earn and women hold 51% of good paying management and professional jobs.
Yet a study released Thursday said men still hold about nine out of every ten top positions at the 400 largest companies in California.
The results have remained largely unchanged in five years of studies from the University of California, Davis.

No 3. 
A corporation is themost complex kind of business organization.
Corporations can sell stock as a way to raise money.
Stock represents shares of ownership in a company.
Investors who buy stock can trade their shares or keep them as long as the company is in business.
A company might use some of its earnings to pay dividends as a reward to shareholders, or the company might reinvest the money back into the business.
If shares lose value, investors can lose all of the money they paid to for their stock.
But shareholders are not responsible forthe debts of the corporation.

Student: I see that a comprehensive exam is required for my major, and I'm not exactly sure what a comprehensive exam is.
Prof: A comprehensive exam is an exam that you take in the final quarter of your studies.
Its purpose is to determine your overall competency.
Student: How is this comprehensive exam different from a final exam?
Prof: A final exam covers all the material taught in a specific course. A comprehensive exam, on the other hand, covers all of the materials taught in the entire program.
Student: And it's true that the comprehensive exam is required for my major?
Prof: It's not an option? No, it's not an option. A comprehensive exam isn't required for all majors at this university, but it is required for your major. Sorry, it's not optional.

 Ron, what are you doing?
 Ah, nothing. I'm just looking up some information on the Internet.
 Like what? Let me see.
 No, no, it's okay. I mean, you know...
 Badness? What are you looking that up for?
 Well, you know...
 I mean, you're not that bad off.
 Ah, there you go, bringing it up again.
 No, I mean it. You look great. Honestly, it's not that bad.
 Hey, I get enough of it from friends and the people at work, and now from you.
 Well, maybe you could wear a toupee. I think you'd look great.
 Oh, no. And have it slip off my head onto my date's dinner plate as I lean over to kiss her? Uh-uh.
 Well, have you ever thought about seeking medical advice?
 There are new advances in medicines that not only retard hair loss, but help regenerate new growth.
 I still don't give much credibility to medical treatment to prevent permanent hair loss.
 Well, what about accepting the fact that you're just losing your hair?
 Well, I just can't give up hope. I know appearances shouldn't matter, but...
 I don't know. I just feel that women just avoid me.
 Come on. You can't be serious.
 Oh, really? I've seen it many times. It just... I don't know.

#### Task 6
```
 Hey, may be the key to a happy marriage. This is BreakingNewsEnglish.com
 Researchers have found the key to a happy marriage. This secret ingredient
 could be a difference in height between the two partners. South Korea's Professor
 Ki-Tae Son said the taller the husband is, the happier the wife is. Mr. Son said
 a greater height difference in a couple was positively related to the wife's
 happiness. He added that the attraction of a tall husband does not last forever.
 He said it disappears after 18 years or so of marriage. Professor Son did not
 know why women preferred taller men. He said, although it has been known that
 women prefer tall men in mating for evolutionary reasons, no study has
 investigated whether a taller husband makes his wife happier. He wrote,
 women simply like tall men. This is similar to people favoring fatty, salty and sugary
 foods without knowing exactly why. However, the BBC said shorter men can be
 better husbands.

Vài tuần trước chính phủ Mỹ đã phải đóng cửa và nếu như Mỹ không quyết định nâng trần nợ công vào ngày 17 tháng 10 tất cả chúng ta sẽ rơi vào trạng thái suy thoái toàn cầu. Về cơ bản nếu quốc hội không nâng mức nợ trần vào ngày 17 tháng 10 thì chính phủ Mỹ sớm muộn sẽ rơi vào cảnh cạn kiệt ngân sách. Nếu điều đó xẩy ra không ai biết chính xác điều gì sẽ diễn ra vì chưa hề có tiền lệ, nhưng chắc hẳn không phải là điều tốt: đóng băng thị trường tín dụng, đồng đô la rớt giá thê thảm lãi suất thì tăng vọt, suy thoái kinh tế, khủng hoảng tài chính toàn cầu, mọi người hoảng loạn.

A new report says the number of young people without a job is still very high in many countries.
There are currently 73 million people around the world, aged 15 to 24, who want to work but cannot find a job.
The International Labour Organization, ILO, said that although youth unemployment is coming down in rich countries, it is rising in most of Asia, the Middle East, North Africa and Brazil.
The youth unemployment rate in China increased from 9.3% in 2010 to 10.6% last year.
Economists say it will be 11.1% in 2016.The ILO warns that youth unemployment worldwide is set to rise.

#### Task 10

Earth has lost half its trees because of humans. There is good and bad news about trees on our planet.
The good news is that there are seven times more than we thought.
Scientists estimated that the world had 400 billion trees.
A new study says we have 3 trillion trees.  
That's a 3 followed by 12 zeros. There are over 420 trees for every person alive today.  
A researcher said it's not good news for the world or bad news that we've produced this new number.
The bad news is that the Earth once had 6 trillion trees. Humans have cut that number in half. Europe used to be a giant forest. Now much of it is fields and cities. We are responsible for the loss of 3 trillion trees. Another 15 billion trees are lost each year. Scientists said this number is a lot higher than 100 years ago. The researcher warned that we must try harder to bring back healthy forests worldwide.

#### Task 11 
```
For many homeowners, refinancing their home mortgages can provide numerous financial benefits over the long run. For one, you can lower your monthly mortgage payments by taking advantage of lower interest rates. This amount can be significant depending on the market rates.  
Second, reducing your mortgage can provide you with additional funds to finance other  
home improvements, like repairing that leaky roof, adding a garage, or building an addition  
onto your home. Furthermore, by refinancing, you can greatly reduce the length of your loan. After several years into your mortgage, people often earn more money than when they first purchased their home, and thus have a surplus to pay off loans quicker. Whatever you do, be sure to gather all the facts about refinancing to make the best informed decision that will meet your current and future needs.

9 nguyên nhân khiến bạn thất bại trên con đường khởi nghiệp.

Điều đầu tiên khởi nghiệp khi chưa đủ giỏi, giỏi ở đây là đánh giá tổng hợp về kỹ năng của bạn: marketing sale tổ chức lãnh đạo đối ngoại. Những người giỏi còn thất bại huống chi mình còn non nớt không giỏi đừng mơ thành công và hãy cố gắng là đi làm thuê trước khi tự tiến hành thành lập công ty.

Điều thứ hai, khởi nghĩa một mình, đây có lẽ là một trong những lý do mà ban quản trị lập ra cái group này. Cho dù bạn giỏi đến trường nào cũng không thể tự tay xây dựng lâu đài riêng cho mình được. Bình thường nghĩ là mình có thể một tay tạo dựng tham vọng Nhưng thực tế không phải thời gian mỗi ngày chỉ có 24 giờ dù giỏi đến mức độ kinh thiên động địa bàn cũng không thể vượt qua giới hạn thời gian và sức khỏe Hãy tìm những người cùng chí hướng và xây dựng với họ một đế chế việc.

Thứ ba khởi nghiệp khi chưa đủ kinh nghiệm khởi nghiệp Nếu bạn chưa tìm hiểu kỹ về những vấn đề liên quan đến kinh doanh của mình thì rất nguy hiểm kinh doanh là tiền thật chứ không phải là Nháp. Nếu sai lầm mất đồng tiền đồng nghĩa với phá sản có khi mất cả máu. Những vấn đề liên quan những pháp luật kế toán nắm bắt quy trình phân phối kênh quảng cáo xây dựng mối quan hệ hỗ trợ kinh doanh. Hãy tìm cho mình một ngọn hải đăng một người đi trước ở cùng lĩnh vực để học hỏi. Đừng bước ra thương trường khi bạn chưa đủ kinh nghiệm.

Thứ tư chọn sản phẩm dịch vụ không phù hợp. Để khởi nghiệp chúng ta nên chọn một sản phẩm có một trong những yếu tố sau: nhà cung ứng uy tín và một đời sản phẩm lâu dài, nhu cầu cao, tỷ suất lợi nhuận lớn. Đôi khi nếu sản phẩm mang tính chất độc quyền thì cũng là một yếu tố tốt bởi nếu không có yếu tố trên bạn sẽ chuyển qua sản phẩm dịch vụ khác và sẽ mất thời gian ban đầu. Đối với những các bạn phân phối tạp hóa đại lý làm tiêu dùng thì chỉ khác ở chỗ chọn nhóm sản phẩm dịch vụ mà thôi. Việc chọn một sản phẩm dịch vụ để kinh doanh cả đời mới là thông minh nhất tất nhiên là yếu tố đam mê. Năng khiếu là một yếu tố quan trọng để lựa chọn những dự án quyết định cuối cùng. Đôi khi chúng ta bắt buộc phải làm việc không thích để đạt được thành công trong sự nghiệp.

Thứ năm khởi nghiệp khi chưa nghiên cứu thị trường, nghiên cứu sản phẩm. Buôn bán bất kỳ sản phẩm nào cũng đều có thể trở thành triệu phú và ngược lại kể cả kinh doanh những sản phẩm giá trị nhỏ vài trăm đồng cũng đủ để bạn phá sản. Những người mới khởi nghiệp thường hay có nhận định chủ quan, tưởng bở về sản phẩm dịch vụ của mình giá tốt, chất lượng tốt rồi tôi cũng là người tốt. cung ứng tốt, thị trường ngon Hãy tập trung xem xét các vấn đề như thị trường, đối thủ cạnh tranh, các sản phẩm mình thay thế bạn có lợi gì hơn so với đại lý bán lẻ cấp thấp hay nhà sản xuất khác. Nói chung là hãy nghiên cứu thị trường một cách rõ ràng đừng kinh doanh theo cảm tính.

Thứ Sáu chọn bạn đồng hành không phù hợp. Chắc chắn bạn đã chứng kiến nhiều công ty phá sản vì đồng sáng lập bất đồng quan điểm. Khi mới làm ai cũng nhiệt huyết. Nhưng nếu không phải là những người thực sự phù hợp với bạn thì mâu thuẫn trực tiếp dẫn đến mô hình kinh doanh này đều tất yếu và khi chọn người sử dụng các bạn nên chọn các yếu tố sau: Có công việc chung như là đam mê, người chắc chắn và có trách nhiệm, là người có trình độ chuyên môn tốt trong một lĩnh vực nào đó. mỗi lĩnh vực chỉ chọn một người vốn mạnh nhất, marketing giỏi nhất, ngoại giao tốt nhất. Quan trọng hàng đầu người đó phải có đạo đức, tín nghĩa thật thà, biết hi sinh vì đại cuộc. Riêng đối với những người dối trá. tư lợi cá nhân, cờ bạc đỏ đen loại ngay lập tức. Hãy chọn cho bạn những người đồng hành tốt nhất thì đó là tương lai của bạn.

#### Task 13 - Investment
```
I'd like to talk about three basic investment options. 

First, you can buy shares. You then become a shareholder, that is, part owner of a company. When the company makes a profit, the shareholders get a share of that profit. This payment is called a dividend. The price of shares can go up or down, so there is no guarantee you can make a profit when you sell your shares. However, share prices can rise a lot, so you can make a lot of money. 

Bonds are another type of investment. When you buy a bond, you are lending your money to a company, or sometimes to a government. In return, they agree to pay you a fixed rate of interest on your money. In addition, you get your capital back on a certain date in the future. This is called the date when the bond matures. There is little risk here, but the returns are quite low. 

Finally, you can invest in a mutual fund. This is a collection of shares and bonds. You put your money together with money from other investors. It is sometimes called an open-end fund, because new investors can join the fund at any time. You pay a financial professional, a fund manager, to handle your investment. The fund manager decides what shares and bonds to buy and sell. There isn't a predictable rate of return. Your earnings change from day to day.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has warned Turkey that it would pay for the downing of  
one of its warplanes on Tuesday. This comes after two Turkish F-16 fighter jets shot down a Russian Su-24, saying the Russian jet was flying over Turkish airspace. Moscow denies this and said its plane was over Syrian airspace. Turkey has warned Russia several times before after Russian planes flew over Turkish territory. Turkey said its fighter pilots warned the Russian pilots 10 times before they fired missiles at them.

However, the Russian pilot who survived the shooting said he received no warnings at all and that he was not flying over Turkish airspace. Russia said the shooting was planned beforehand.President Putin has advised all Russians to avoid going to Turkey. He has also said Russia would cut many economic ties with Turkey. Several major Russian holiday firms have removed packages to Turkey. This could hurt Turkey as 4.4 million Russians go there on vacation each year. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said a number of big joint projects between the two countries would be stopped. In addition, Turkish companies with strong trading ties to Russia will also face more difficult trading conditions.  
Turkey imports almost all of its energy from Russia, including 60% of its gas and 35% of its oil. Russia is also due to build Turkey's first nuclear power station, which is a $20 billion project.This is Cynthia Hitz reporting from Pennsylvania in the United States.

On Wednesday, President Obama proposed major changes to rebuild government supervision of the financial industry. The current economic downturn grew out of a culture of irresponsible lending and borrowing and a failure of the entire system, he said.  
He says a new system is needed to meet the speed and complexity of a 21st century global  
economy. One goal is to increase supervision of big companies whose failure could threaten the financial system. The Federal Reserve would gain new powers. The idea is to identify troubled companies early.

#### Task 20

Two recent economic reports warn that although the world economy is growing, complicating issues like lower oil prices and conflict could hurt progress. The International Monetary Fund, or IMF, has reduced its prediction for world economic growth from 3.8 to 3.5 percent.  
That is still an improvement over 2014. But the international lender says some major economies are facing economic struggles. The price of oil is about half of what it was last June. The IMF's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, says lower oil prices have helped many major economies, but investment has dropped in oil-exporting countries. U.N. economists predict growth this year will be 3.1 percent. They point out that crises like the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and conflict in Ukraine could hurt a world economy, showing signs of improvement.

Number 1.  
Early estimates show that the United States economy began to grow again in July, August,  
and September. The 3.5 percent growth was the first expansion in more than a year, and the strongest in two years. The government said increases in consumer spending and exports and improvements in business investment led the growth. So did increased federal spending and housing investments. But high unemployment could limit growth for some time.  

Number 2.  
The National Association of Colleges and Employers says about one-fourth of those who  
applied for a job have found one. NACE says that is up a little from last year, but the number is down sharply from 2007, the year before the financial crash.  
Starting pay is also down. Josh Safran graduated from American University in Washington with a business degree. He is still looking for a job.  

Number 3.  
The National Association for Business Economics has its latest predictions for the American  
economy. Most of the 45 business economists questioned said they expect the recession to end in the second half of the year.But they also expect a slower than usual recovery.  
Still there were more signs this week that Americans are feeling better about the economy.

Can you think your way to wealth and success? Napoleon Hill believed that if you think the right thoughts, you can. In 1937, he published the book Think and Grow Rich. Napoleon Hill spent many years researching financial success and observing people who had become rich. Although it was published in the middle of the Great Depression, it was an immediate success. Think and Grow Rich remains one of the most popular nonfiction books ever written. Forbes magazine says it has sold 70 million copies since it first appeared and continues to sell today. Napoleon Hill wrote at least 10 other books about success before his death in 1970. None of Hill's books came close to selling as many copies as Think and Grow Rich.

Leaders of Southeast Asian nations are in Malaysia this weekend for talks on terrorism, territorial disputes, and trade. The Leaders' Summit is their last meeting before the launch of the ASEAN Economic Community, or AEC, on December 31st. But some business leaders have low expectations for the ASEAN Summit. Anthony Nelson is a director at the U.S. ASEAN Business Council in Washington. He believes that security will be an important issue at the meetings,  
especially after the terrorist attacks in Paris last week. The November summit includes the East Asia Summit, which primarily focuses on political and security issues. So that's going to be a big part of what is actually going on around the summit. A lot of the work that business gets really involved in tends to happen around the ASEAN Economic Ministers meeting in August. But the AEC may have only limited influence on business activity when it comes into being next year. Experts expect little to change at first, because there is still much to be done.

1. In Asia, building roads, railways, and other important infrastructure has been slower,  
partly because of the 1997 financial crisis. After that crisis, developing Asian countries reduced the amount they spend on infrastructure.  

2. In Vietnam, the government approved plans for a new airport near Ho Chi Minh City. Vietnam also plans to spend $22.5 billion on new highways. The demand for power in that country increases by 10% every year. State media say Vietnam needs to spend $125 billion in the next 20 years to keep up with the demand.

3.Germany, Europe's largest economy, has been pushing for economic reform in the 17 countries using the Euro. But German Chancellor Angela Merkel has argued that her country is unwilling to put money at risk unless banking reform is enacted throughout the Eurozone.  
She warned this week that Germany's economic power was not unlimited. The proposals include empowering nations to intervene when their banks are in trouble.

5/ Quý vị và các bạn thân mến, hiện giờ thì chúng tôi đã đến được chợ Bến Thành đây là một trong những biểu tượng của thành phố Hồ Chí Minh và các bạn có biết là tại sao chợ Bến Thành có tên là chợ Bến Thành không. Thì trước đây vào thế kỷ 18 thì chợ Bến Thành chỉ là một ngôi chợ nhỏ nó nằm ở sát bên dòng sông Bến Nghé và nằm gần với Thành Gia Định hồi xưa cho nên người ta mới gọi đây là ngôi chợ này là chợ Bến Thành. Là ghép chữ Bến Nghé và Thành Gia Định thành chợ Bến Thành. Và nơi đây có rất đầy đủ các mặt hàng, mặt hàng nào cũng có ở đây hết. Bây giờ chúng ta sẽ vào chợ Bến Thành và tham quan.

--> Dear ladies and gentlemen, now we have arrived at Ben Thanh market, this is one of the symbols of Ho Chi Minh City and do you know why Ben Thanh market is called Ben Thanh market? . Previously, in the 18th century, Ben Thanh market was just a small market, located next to the Ben Nghe river and close to Gia Dinh Citadel in the past, so people called this market Ben Thanh market. . Combining the words Ben Nghe and Thanh Gia Dinh to form Ben Thanh market. And this place has a full range of items, every item is available here. Now we will go to Ben Thanh market and visit.

The first time I interpreted was for an American professor who came to Vietnam to teach about pre-school education. And it was my first time. I was very green, meaning very inexperienced. But I did a good job because I knew that I was not all that good and that I needed to pay more attention to what I did. So, even though it was a little bit intense, but it was very good. From then on, through my words of mouth, I got a lot more offers. And since I was very responsible for what I did, I had offers from many interesting and supposedly high-ranking people. So, my job with the American embassy was a result of such a process and I got an offer to start interpreting for the ambassador. And I understood that it was a huge responsibility. But starting on, I really tried my best and started to learn more about different things, political, economic. And I think you need to have a very good knowledge, general knowledge, when you work as an interpreter. And also, you have to understand the cultural characteristics of the country whose language you are interpreting into and your own language. So, I think I did a good job. And that's not only what I'm saying, but I got a lot of compliments from people I worked for too. So, I think being an interpreter is very interesting after all.

2.  
G-8 leaders met with partners from major developing economies, including India, China, and Brazil. All agreed that global temperatures should not rise by more than an average of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. G-8 members promised to work toward an 80 percent cut in heat-trapping pollution by 2050. Developing nations have committed themselves to negotiating cuts, but have not yet agreed on details.

2. Good planning means placing money into financial securities and accounts that have different risk levels using asset allocation.  

3. Leaders of the world's wealthiest nations have promised $20 billion to increase food security in poor countries. The promise came Friday on the third and final day of the Group of Eight summit meeting in Italy. The announcement followed talks between G8 leaders and leaders from Africa.  

4. Breast cancer screenings based on an individual's age, gender, current health status and risk factor, for example. Breast cancer screenings based on a woman's age and family history.  
5. The National Association for Business Economics has its latest predictions for the American economy. Most of the 45 business economists questioned said they expect the recession to end in the second half of the year. But they also expect a slower-than-usual recovery. Still, there were more signs this week that Americans are feeling better about the economy.  

6. Every summer across the United States, Americans organize yard sales. Single households or several households decide on a date and time to sell all their unwanted things right in front of their homes. You don't need a special permit from any local authority to set up a yard sale. What matters most is good advertising. Several signs on local streets and perhaps an announcement on a local online website are good things to have. Saturday mornings are the most common time for yard sales. They can start as early as 8 o'clock and last well into the afternoon. But by noon, most of the choice items have been sold. Rarely do you see a yard sale take place on a workday.  

7. Double negatives cannot be very unuseful in cases where your meaning isn't not unbinary.  
For example, not unintelligent implies some middle ground between intelligence and unintelligent. Just don't make sure that you don't use double negatives not uncarefully.

#### Task 22

1. India, Vietnam, and others have restricted exports to keep prices down at home and protect 
supplies. Vietnam, the world's second-largest rice exporter, has banned exports until June, and Vietnamese officials have now warned that traders who buy rice for speculation will be severely punished.  

2. The United States gave an emergency order to restrict naked short-selling. This is a form of stock trading that is being blamed for sharp drops in the price of some financial stocks.  
With naked short-selling, trading takes place with shares that have not yet been borrowed  
and may never be. Naked shorting lets traders short-sell large amounts of stock that may not be available to borrow in the market. 
Sometimes lenders of securities tell several short-sellers that they can borrow the same shares, but naked short-selling is not out of control. 

3. Internet activists and human rights groups are criticizing an order that requires blogs and social media sites in Vietnam to share personal information only. The order aims to ban social media users and bloggers from posting other information such as news stories.  
Local media reports say the decree states that such sites are not permitted to quote,  
gather or summarize information from press organizations or government websites.  
Internet activists say this is an attempt by the communist government to restrict freedom  
of speech.  
One blogger says that is a matter of personal choice. People should be able to decide for themselves whether information is good or bad. And Vietnamese citizens do not need the government to teach them how to think.

#### Task 23
```
1. I will now give you some examples of how EU relations with Africa works.  
There is not a one-size-fits-all description of how EU foreign policy-making towards Africa is done. It's an idealised model. In reality, things play out differently.  

2. Today, I am delighted to introduce to you Michel Spalding. Michel is a savvy entrepreneur, soulful business coach, and fairy godmother to many. Michel created a business that supports her in following her passions for adventure, travel, and fun.  Her wish is to help you blend inspiration, creativity, passion, and adventure to create the life of your dreams.  

3. The new hybrid car I'm looking at comes at an affordable price. Its excellent fuel economy and stylish design are also advantages. Unfortunately, it doesn't offer much room in the back for passengers. Since I have a lot of friends, I see its lack of spaciousness as its Achilles heel.
